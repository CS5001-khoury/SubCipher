1. Thinking about for-in loops, they all work on sequential data, so based on that, what is each "item" for each of these sequential data types. Separate each item by a comma after the => symbol. 
    * Example: range(1, 3) => 1, 2
    * ('aloha', 'world') => 
    * ['aloha', 'world'] =>
    * 'aloha world' =>

2. For this for-in loop, write an equivalent while loop. 
```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```
```python
# your code here

```
